UW-EE399-Machine-Learning-Demonstrations
=========
This repository holds all of my coding assignments as I learn to develop machine learning algorithms from the ground floor. The repository begins with fitting simple models to data and moves towards more complex machine learning algorithims as I investigate and experiment with these during the course of a quarter at UW. Assignments were designed by Professor Nathan Kurtz.

Homework 1
---------------------
The assignment starts with linear and polynomial optimizations to model a small dataset. These models demonstrate some of the flaws and cautions necessary when fitting data to a model and how overparameterization can lead to massive error when the training data differs from the testing data (demonstrated in parts 3 and 4). This assignment also leads to show how when using a non-linear

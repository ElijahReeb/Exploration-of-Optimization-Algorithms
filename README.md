UW-EE399-Machine-Learning-Demonstrations
=========
This repository holds all of my coding assignments as I learn to develop machine learning algorithms from the ground floor. The repository begins with fitting simple models to data and moves towards more complex machine learning algorithims as I investigate and experiment with these during the course of a quarter at UW. Assignments were designed by Professor Nathan Kurtz.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The assignment starts with linear and polynomial optimizations to model a small dataset. These models demonstrate some of the flaws and cautions necessary when fitting data to a model and how overparameterization can lead to massive error when the training data differs from the testing data (demonstrated in parts 3 and 4). This assignment also leads to show how when using a non-linear functions there may be many minima and thus a more local minimum is necessary (part 2). 

Theoretical Backgroud
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This assignment mostly uses code functions to optimize the models. The main measure of how good a model is the least squared error. When one is determining a model it makes intuitive sense to chose a model that produces outputs close to each of the expected outputs. The first part of this assignment focused simply on that. Using a cosine function to model the data
